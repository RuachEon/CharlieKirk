    <p style="font-weight:600;font-size:1.05rem;color:#10202b;line-height:1.6;margin:0 0 14px 0;">
      Charlie Kirk, founder and president of Turning Point USA, shaped a major movement aimed at engaging young Americans with conservative principles: freedom, limited government, faith, and personal responsibility.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:1rem;line-height:1.6;margin:0 0 14px 0;color:#24303d;">
      Through Turning Point USA, he helped build one of the country's most visible student movements. From campus chapters to national conferences, he created forums where students could discuss ideas, sharpen leadership skills, and find the confidence to speak up for their beliefs.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:1rem;line-height:1.6;margin:0 0 14px 0;color:#24303d;">
      As a communicator, Charlie translated complex political topics into direct, easy-to-follow messages. Whether speaking at events, hosting his podcast, or connecting online, he reached millions and encouraged young people to take part in civic life.
    </p>

    <p style="padding:12px 16px;margin:16px 0;border-left:4px solid rgba(20,90,255,0.1);
              border-radius:12px;background:#ffffffa6;font-style:italic;font-size:1rem;line-height:1.6;color:#0f1724;">
      His approach inspired many but also provoked criticism some questioned the tactics and tone used by his movement, while others praised the clarity and conviction of his message.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:1rem;line-height:1.6;margin:0 0 14px 0;color:#24303d;">
      For supporters, he was a bold voice for conservative renewal among youth. For critics, his methods were often polarizing. Both views underscore that his influence was significant and widely debated.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:0.92rem;color:#52606a;line-height:1.6;margin:0;">
      Ultimately, Charlie Kirk’s legacy will be measured by the leaders he helped shape and the conversations he changed a reminder that committed activism can leave a lasting mark on public life.

        <p>Dear Erika and family,</p>
        <p>Like David encouraged himself in the Lord, I encourage you to also find your strength in Him. 
        Even in the valley of grief, the Lord is near to the brokenhearted. Your labor of love, faith, 
        and testimony through this season is not in vain.</p>
        <p>Remember the promise in <strong>Revelation 21:4</strong>:</p>
        <blockquote>“He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, 
        for the old order of things has passed away.”</blockquote>
        <p>May the God of all comfort surround you with His peace, until that glorious day when we will see Him face to face.</p>
